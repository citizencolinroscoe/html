<div>
    <p>
            On my first page I first put a banner across the top and tried to do it with each page.<br>
            Underneath that I then put a navigation bar with heading links that would take you to each different page.<br>
            These headings relate to the home page, Unit 1.1, Unit 1.2, Unit 1.3, Unit 2.1, Home page in Persian and the Home page in Arabic<br> 
            The background screen is of the Aurora Borialis.<br>
            Next comes the the heading “About Me” followed by a little picture of me.<br>
            After this is a subheading welcoming you to my blog.<br>
            The next few paragraphs are a brief tale about me, my past and my interests<br>
            Accompanied with images that kind of relate to me.<br>
            Then at the bottom there are contact details.<br>
            Then there is a link which will take you back to the top menu if pressed.<br>
            The next page has the banner at the top of the screen, just like the first screen.<br>
            Below that then is the navigation bar.<br>
            Then comes the business part. All answers and research collated for Unit 1 section 1.1 to 1.7.<br>
            Finally at the bottom of the page then is a link to take you back to the top of the screen.<br>
            The third page again starts with the banner followed by the navigation bar.<br> Then come the headings followed by the answers and research required unit 1 section 2.1 to 2.5.<br>
            Finally finishing at the bottom of the page with a link to take back to the top.<br>
            Page 3 then is again started with the banner followed by navigation bar.<br> After a heading, answers for Unit1 section 3 follow.<br> To the end the page is the link to take you back to the top.
            The next page follows the same continuity at the top of the page.<br> The banner, background picture and navigation bar has the same look.<br> The only thing that differs is the content.<br> All research and answers for Outcome 2 section 1 are answered here.<br> Then comes the link to take you back to the top.<br>
            Then come 2 pages translated into Persian.<br> The first page is a translated page About Me.<br> the second page is the answers and research for Unit 1 section 1.<br>
            There is also a second navigation bar, in Persian, to navigate between the pages.<br>
            The next 2 pages are the same as the Persian pages but translated into Arabic.<br>

    <p>
            Copyright protects ANY piece of work regardless of who created it <br>and permission will be required to either use it, display it or distribute it.<br> Any complaint about copyright infringement should result in taking down the offending image or article until investigations can prove one way or another if there is an infringement.<br>
            There are legal restrictions on downloading and uploading software.<br> Again permission is usually required and licenses are usually acquired.<br>
            GDPR is another constraint.<br> It must strictly be adhered too else there are severe penalties.<br> GDPR is a digital version of data protection.<br> Personal and private information must not be available for just anyone and everyone to access at any time.<br> They must be protected.

            1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using web pages and how we can overcome them 
    </h2>

    <p>
            For those with visual impairments, learning difficulties, hearing loss and more, there are dozens of unique challenges waiting behind every URL.<br> But building a disability-friendly site is a lot simpler than you might think.<br>
            Using alt tags with a screen reader will greatly help someone with visual impairment.<br>
            Providing subtitles or a transcript would also help.<br>
            Putting full stops in abbreviations is also simple yet effective help when using a screen reader.<br>
            Describing the links and making them standout using different colours is also a simple yet effective way of helping.<br>
            Just making clickable buttons bigger is a simple yet tremendous help for someone with mobility issues.<br>
            If your website is made disability friendly, why not create a page<br> that tells them about your features and helps them get the most out of the tools and features you are providing!!<br>
            Research into how your target users actually use their own browsers.<br> How they set up and use what they have.<br> This will really help creating something disability friendly and very useful and easy to use! [1]<br>
            As well as screen readers for the visually impaired or blind, for death people there are refreshable braille applications available.<br>
            Simply put, a refreshable braille display is a piece of hardware that provides braille output from your computer, smartphone, or tablet.<br> Buttons on the Braille Display or the keyboard commands on the connected device would move the focus to the next line.<br> Each braille cell on a braille display can show up to 8 dots.<br>
            In the UK, the Disability Discrimination Act covers web accessibility for blind and disabled users,<br> and it compels some business owners to ensure their websites can be used by everyone.<br>
