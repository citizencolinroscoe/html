        About Me
</h1>
<P><b>HI there. Thanks for stopping by and taking the time to read my blog.</b>
<br>
<br>
Born in November 1979 in the city of Manchester I am a proud Mancunian.<br>
As a child I always enjoyed sports. With a great group of friends, we always entertained ourselves playing one type of sport or another.<br>
At school, sports teams were part and parcel of my school life. I enjoyed and was proud to represent my school playing football, rugby league and union, cricket, basketball and any other sport they would let us play.<br>
I was even lucky enough to have trials for several sports teams for football and managed to make one appearance for the first professional mens team of Oldham Roughyeads RLFC and one boxing bout against newly crowned England schools boys champion (which I won and seemed like a good time to leave to boxing behind)
From being a young boy I have always been an avid fan of Manchester City FC and spent many a Saturday afternoon on the Kippax, and still enjoy visiting the Etihad Stadium.
