        <p>Being new to HTML and CSS, every little thing i tried to do,<br> whether it worked or not, always took time to do.<br> Time seemed to fritter away rather quickly trying to research hints and help.<br> If the subject had not been so personal then it would have been very beneficial working in a team.<br> Each member then could research different tasks and then pass on the information to each other.<br> With the use of a kanban board in Trello would have kept each member of the team up to date,<br> as it did as i worked solo on this project.</p>

                With more practice and more time,<br> I could gain more proficiency using Visual Studio Code with HTML, CSS and Javascript.<br>
                With much more knowledge and understanding of the tools available to use on HTML and CSS,<br> I could do things much quicker and able to add so much more to the development of my webpage.<br> Again with more knowledge and practice of Javascript I could add much more function to my page.

                Next time, having gained experience of this project, I certainly set myself realistic goals and time frames for each task.<br> Never be afraid to ask for help or advice!<br> I am still learning so I will not have all the answers or knowledge.<br> So ask  and question and get as many opinions and answers as you can!<br>
                Next time I would certainly choose to work as part of a team.<br>Tasks can then be spread with the use of Trello.<br> Advice can then be sought by fellow team members via Slack.<br> It would then be easier to stick within time restraints.

    <div>
        <p>
                To test a digital solution I would open the page and try to run each function,<br> checking that each function looks and does what it is supposed to do.<br> Then passing it on to colleagues to use and check to see if they can use and navigate through the page as I had planned,<br> without the bias I would more than likely have using my own design.<br>My colleagues can then see if there are any bugs that exist which I will not see with my own eyes.
