                Planning on doing my own website seems overwhelming at first.
                <br>
                 Where do I start? What do I do? HELP!!<br>
                Not to worry. Firstly I create my own Kanban board on Trello.<br> On there I start to list the tasks I know I will need to do.<br> On seeing these cards there I can then make a start.<br> This kanban board helps to organise my mind and i can see and start working on what I need to start with.<br>
                Google searches are of great inspiriation for research. A world wide library at your finger tips!<br>
                Google Drive is a cloud storage system that becomes of great use.<br> Being able to make notes of my research and storing it all in one place.<br> I can easily access what i have at a moments notice no matter where i am, as long as I have access to my Google account.<br>
                Researching and learning and practicing how websites are being writtain and coded.<br> Learning what language is used. HTML and CSS have to be researched and learnt and practised in order for me to effectively create an interesting webpage.<br>
                Github is a great storage device that runs well with Visual Studio Code.<br> Visual Studio Code will be used to create the new website and how it will look.<br> Using HTML, CSS and Javascript to design and code my website.<br> Github will be used to save and store all my work done on Virtual Studio Code so i can access my file anywhere as long as I have acess to Github.

                It is reported that between 70 - 80%  of all digital projects fail.<br> It is important to remember that technology is not the solution but only an enabler to success.<br> People are the real key to success!<br>
You need to remember it is not the end when technology is introduced or upgraded.<br> It never stops!<br> People will need training and retraining on how to understand and get the most out of the technology in use.<br> Be constantly looking how to improve and be adaptable to change.<br>

                Firstly, listing what Aims and results you are looking for.<br> Research on Google will be helpful.<br> Networking and chatting to people with different skills and experiences in the fields appropriate will help too.<br> 
Once you have an idea of what programmes and tools are out there to help you achieve what  you are wanting to achieve, it’s a matter of practice, practice and more practice!<br> Mistakes will be made, but things will become easier to use and understand the more you practice!<br>
Chatting with my tutor and fellow classmates,<br> reading up I noticed that html and css is what is used to create a website and using functions in Javascript is what gives the website the functions and creates the magic!<br>
Whilst creating a native app for iOS I researched and spoke to classmates and found out about X Code to design and run a dummy app as a project.<br> The tools on that programme helped greatly to design and run a simulator on how the app would work.

                I first set up a kanban board on “Trello” which helped to start loading cards with tasks i knew i would have to do.<br> This helped formulate a plan of attack and where I should start.<br>https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/<br>
                https://www.w3schools.com/<br>
                https://codepen.io/<br>Are great websites for help and tips!<br>
                Youtube was also a great source for videos of tips and help. A great visual aid I could follow.<br>
                Visual Studio Code is a fantastic programme, easy to use and easy to write your code onto.<br> Highlighting errors as they happen so you can really keep track as to where you are upto.<br> Keep saving as I go I could see how my website was turning out with each code added.<br>
                Github was a big help.<br> It meant I could store and save everything in one place and work from anywhere providing i had access to my GitHub account.
