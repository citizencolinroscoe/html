                Whilst on the project of making and designing my own website blog I used Visual Studio Code to write up the website<br> using HTML, CSS and Javascript.<br> It is a programme that seems very popular and very easy to use.<br> Works well with Github where i can save and store all work done.<br>
                Trello  really helped with me keeping track where i was upto with my project.<br> What needed doing, what was urgent and what tasks I could plan for.<br>
                Codepen was a useful website for practicing on.<br> It was full of helpful hints and ideas.<br> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/<br>
                https://www.w3schools.com/<br>
                 were also a great source of information on how i could code and design my website.<br>
                Slack came in useful to speak to colleagues for advice and help if and when needed.

                Visual Studio Code was the perfect tool to use for designing my website.<br> It allowed me to combine my HTML, CSS and Javascript files to run together to help code, function and design my web page.<br> It also runs easily with Github where i was saving and storing work done.<br>
                Trello really helped me break down the project into tasks and was really easy to keep track of where i was upto with the tasks set.<br> Enabling me to make a plan for the next few hours if not the day.<br>
                Slack was useful to get help and opinions of my colleagues no matter where any of us were.
