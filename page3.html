                Whilst on the project of making and designing my own website blog I used Visual Studio Code to write up the website<br> using HTML, CSS and Javascript.<br> It is a programme that seems very popular and very easy to use.<br> Works well with Github where i can save and store all work done.<br>
                Trello  really helped with me keeping track where i was upto with my project.<br> What needed doing, what was urgent and what tasks I could plan for.<br>
                Codepen was a useful website for practicing on.<br> It was full of helpful hints and ideas.<br> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/<br>
                https://www.w3schools.com/<br>
                 were also a great source of information on how i could code and design my website.<br>
                Slack came in useful to speak to colleagues for advice and help if and when needed.

                Visual Studio Code was the perfect tool to use for designing my website.<br> It allowed me to combine my HTML, CSS and Javascript files to run together to help code, function and design my web page.<br> It also runs easily with Github where i was saving and storing work done.<br>
                Trello really helped me break down the project into tasks and was really easy to keep track of where i was upto with the tasks set.<br> Enabling me to make a plan for the next few hours if not the day.<br>
                Slack was useful to get help and opinions of my colleagues no matter where any of us were.

                Am I happy with my website?<br>
                I think the honest answwer is no!<br>
                 As a first attempt at trying anything like this and I am quite proud of the attempt.<br> However I found everything seemed to consume so much more time than anticipated.<br> I managed to translate some documented work but not all.<br> I wanted to put the translated work on to show that I had done it, even though it's a little incomplete.<br>
                And there are always different design ideas running through my head.<br>
                I would probably be making changes until the end of my days if there was not a deadline!

                Improvements I could make to my website.<br> I would like to get better images on there.<br> More time to play around with the design and look and feel of the website.<br> I think I just settled on certain images to save time and because they worked.<br> I certainly need a good picture of  myself since the blog is about me!!<br>	
                I would dearly like to include more functions on the site.<br> Different fonts, colours, buttons and navigation bars.<br> For example, rather than having everything on my task bar I was looking into making a dropdown button for some of the language features.<br>
                Things I believe would make the website easier to navigate around and better on the eye.

        <p>
                Discussing problems and solutions I have found and that have been suggested to me by my tutor or fellow classmates.<br> I try to implement them and then suggest someone else should try to navigate their way round using the functions.<br> This checks that the functions work and the website is  easily navigable. <br>
                By checking and rechecking the tasks I was set,<br> I set them up as tasks on a Trello board so I could have reminders at my fingertips as to what i needed to achieve.
